<p>There's more to Web Design than just making a site look nice.</p> 

<p>The Travel and Computer sections of the jsinsurance.co.uk website that I designed and coded the HTML for scored very highly in an independant usability test.</p>

<p>This involved submitting the site to vigourous testing to see how easy users found the site to use and navigate around.</p>
