<p>A Content Management System (CMS) is a secure part of a website, usually only accessible by the owner of the site via a secure password system. It basically does what it says on the tin in that allows the user to "Manage the Content" of the site such as adding text to a diary page, uploading photos to a photo gallery or displaying a list of new orders for an online shop. The changes are usually done via forms displayed on the screen by the web browser.</p>
