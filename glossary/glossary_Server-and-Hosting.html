<p>You need to get Hosting for your website as somewhere to store the files used by your site. A server is a computer, permanently running and connected to the internet that contains the files used by your website, and serves them up to a browser that requests them.</p>
<p>When choosing a Hosting company you usually get a choice of what type of Operating System the Server Uses, Microsoft Windows Server, or Linux. Although Microsoft may seem to be the obvious choice to use as it is what the majority of desktop computers run on, most web servers run on Unix or Linux based systems as they are generally more suited for this purpose.</p> 
<p>Personally, I recommend Unix / Linux based systems as that is what I have learnt to program on and I prefer to use the Open Source languages and systems, PHP and MySQL that come with Linux.</p>
