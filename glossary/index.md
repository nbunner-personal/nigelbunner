title: A glossary of terminology related to designing websites and the technology behind them

I have set up this part of the site to help explain some of the terminology used elsewhere for those who may find some of it confusing. It is very easy to take for granted a knowledge of web design terms when many people have no idea what a Domain Name is or what Browser Compatibility means. Fortunately if you want to learn such things this hopefully should be a place to to do so.

These are only meant to be brief introductions to each subject. You can find out more about each one by following some of the links I've included or by doing a search on Wikipedia or Google.

Please select a term from the list below to begin.
