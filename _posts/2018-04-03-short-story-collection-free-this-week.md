Here's a preview:

<blockquote>    
    <h3>For you I hide This</h3>
    <p>A fascinating collection of twelve short stories drawn from Nigelâ€™s experiences and imagination. A magical trail under the stairs offers a glimpse into a future self, the hidden words written on postcards on a wall, a cat who tries to break free from its natural instinct to eat everything that moves, the joy of taking the day off to play in a snow covered landscape and the heartfelt tale of living with dementia. Each story is based on a song from Nigel's debut album Postcards performing as indie folk artist Sugardrum.</p>
