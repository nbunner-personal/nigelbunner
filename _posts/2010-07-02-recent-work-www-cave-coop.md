The <a title="The Cave Coop" href="http://www.cave.coop" target="_blank">Cave Co-operative</a> specialise in <a title="The Cave Coop" href="http://www.cave.coop" target="_blank">Sustainable Architecture</a>. They came up with some nice design ideas for the site such as a general style guide for the colour and typography and prepared most of the main images themselves. I helped them with the overal layout, coding the site and putting all our ideas together.

<div id="attachment_65" style="width: 590px" class="wp-caption aligncenter">
  <a href="http://www.cave.coop"><img class="size-full wp-image-65 " title="cave-screenshot" src="/img/wp-blog/2010/07/cave-screenshot.jpg" alt="Cave Co-operative - sustainable architecture" width="580" height="426" srcset="/img/wp-blog/2010/07/cave-screenshot.jpg 580w, /img/wp-blog/2010/07/cave-screenshot-300x220.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 580px) 100vw, 580px" /></a>
  
  <p class="wp-caption-text">
    www.cave.coop
  </p>
</div>

It&#8217;s a nice project to work on as the site will slowly evolve as they add new content to it. This is something we have already planned for so the existing layout has been designed to be flexible enough to adapt to these changes as and when required.
