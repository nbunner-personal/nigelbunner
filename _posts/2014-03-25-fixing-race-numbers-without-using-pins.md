I&#8217;ve taken part in a couple of races recently and didn&#8217;t want to risk making holes in my top by fixing my race number to it with safety pins.

Fortunately, I had a Spi-Belt that I was going to wear anyway so I folded the number over, stuck the 2 ends together and looped the belt through it. Most race numbers have a bit of excess paper at the top and the bottom which is perfect for doing this whilst still leaving the number visible.

Here are some photos below to show what I mean&#8230;

<div id="attachment_369" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignnone">
  <img class="size-medium wp-image-369 " alt="Fixing race number using tape and a Spi belt" src="/img/wp-blog/2014/03/IMG_2598-300x224.jpg" width="300" height="224" srcset="/img/wp-blog/2014/03/IMG_2598-300x224.jpg 300w, /img/wp-blog/2014/03/IMG_2598-1024x764.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />

You can see how the number is still clearly visible from this photo, and no holes in my running top&#8230;
