I recently went to the launch party for my local Transition Town movement. I&#8217;d heard the term, Transition Town being used for a while as one of my housemates is an architect involved with this, but I had no idea what it was all about apart from knowing that it&#8217;s something eco friendly and generally groovy.

According to their website, Transition Towns is all about&#8230;

<div style="padding-left: 30px;">
  <p>
    <em>a community-led response to the pressures of climate change, fossil fuel depletion and increasingly, economic contraction</em>
  </p>
</div>

So I was right, it is about something eco friendly and groovy. There were all sorts of different ideas being presented at the launch party, among them, sustainable architecture, a food co-op selling locally grown produce, how to make your garden more wildlife friendly and bee keeping.

I didn&#8217;t get a chance to speak to the bee keeper but I hope these new bee keepers are being taught how to keep their bees ethically &#8211; i.e. to encourage the bees to produce a surplus of honey so the bees aren&#8217;t left just feeding on the sugared water that some bee keepers leave them after taking their winter food.
