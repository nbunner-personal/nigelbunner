I&#8217;ve had this lamp since I was a small child; it used to be my night lamp with a coloured bulb in it to help me sleep at night.

I&#8217;ve never seen another one elsewhere except for once when I spotted one on the telly. I did a double take and start pointing crazily at the screen saying to everyone &#8220;that&#8217;s my fish lamp!&#8221; ðŸ™‚
