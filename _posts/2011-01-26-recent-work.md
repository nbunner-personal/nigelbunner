I&#8217;ve been fortunate to be busy with some regular web work for a well known travel client over the past few months so not had much time or the need to do any freelance projects, hence the lack of updates on here.

I have done a couple of projects for friends of mine where they have designed and created mockups of the sites themselves which I&#8217;ve then coded for them and also done some work on my own music site which involved both design and coding, all summarised below:

**www.sugardrum.com**

<div id="attachment_99" style="width: 610px" class="wp-caption aligncenter">
  <a title="Sugardrum Music" href="http://www.sugardrum.com" target="_blank"><img class="size-full wp-image-99 " title="Sugardrum" src="/img/wp-blog/2011/01/Sugardrum-2011.jpg" alt="www.sugardrum.com" width="600" height="466" srcset="/img/wp-blog/2011/01/Sugardrum-2011.jpg 600w, /img/wp-blog/2011/01/Sugardrum-2011-300x233.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></a>
  
  <p class="wp-caption-text">
    www.sugardrum.com
  </p>
</div>

This is my own personal site showcasing my musical projects. I redesigned it about a year ago but there were various parts of it that I hadn&#8217;t had time to finish, so this is what I did recently. The end design looks more complete than the previous one and compliments well with the new <a title="Sugardrum on Bandcamp" href="http://sugardrum.bandcamp.com/" target="_blank">Sugardrum Bandcamp site</a>.

    Matt did the design of this site himself, creating mockups of each page which I then went away and coded up for him, creating a small admin system for him to update sections of it himself.

      Earthsong provide <a title="Earthsong - Multicultural music workshops for schools" href="http://www.earthsong.co.uk" target="_blank">multicultural music workshops for schools</a>. This was another site where the client designed and created mockups of each page themselves, which I then coded up for them. This proved to be quite a challenge, converting the graphically rich designs to look good yet not taking ages to display on the browser. Various techniques were employed to do this and the end result manages to download reasonably quicky on most broadband connections whilst still retaining the look of the original mockups.
