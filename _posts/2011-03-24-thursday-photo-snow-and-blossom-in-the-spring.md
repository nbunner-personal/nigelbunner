<a title="Snow and Blossom on the trees by icle fotos, on Flickr" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/icklephotos/3826125276/" target="_blank"><img src="https://farm4.static.flickr.com/3484/3826125276_f116f2e641.jpg" alt="51620012" width="500" height="332" /></a> 

This was taken a couple of years ago near some woods where I used to live. The weather had got a bit confused with Spring arriving early and spreading beautiful blossom onto the trees. It was the snow settling on the ground, produced by a Winter too reluctant to leave that enticed us outside.
