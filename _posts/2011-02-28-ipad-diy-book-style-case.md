I&#8217;ve been lucky to own an iPad for a months now and it&#8217;s proved very useful for various musical and web related things. When I first got it I had a look around the net for a notebook/moleskin or book style case, and eventually settled on one made by <a title="Treegloo products" href="https://treegloo.com/" target="_blank">Treegloo</a>. It worked well at protecting the iPad and is extremely well constructed but I always felt it was a bit bulky and after looking on the net came to the conclusion that this was a common feature of a lot of these cases i.e. those with a wooden frame surrounded by a book jacket cover such as those from <a title="Portenzo - handmade iPad cases" href="https://shop.portenzo.com/" target="_blank">Portenzo</a> and <a title="iPad Cases by DODOCase" href="https://www.dodocase.com/" target="_blank">DodoCase</a>.

So, after browsing around the net a bit further, I read a post by someone suggesting fixing a silicone case inside the cover of a book&#8230; and that is what I did ðŸ™‚

The silicone case is aÂ [Belkin TPU Grip Vue for iPad &#8211; Clear](https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B003M5VW7K?ie=UTF8&tag=nigebunn-21&linkCode=as2&camp=1634&creative=6738&creativeASIN=B003M5VW7K) <img style="border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;" src="https://www.assoc-amazon.co.uk/e/ir?t=nigebunn-21&l=as2&o=2&a=B003M5VW7K" border="0" alt="" width="1" height="1" />suitableÂ for the current original version of the iPad (iPad 2 hasn&#8217;t been announced at the time of writing this). The book is a copy of Biodynamic Gardening for Health and Taste by Hilary Wright, available for around a fiver from my local charity shop and the case is fixed onto the inside cover of the book using strips of velcro about 1cm wide, a strip on each side, quite close to the edge of the iPad where it curves up so so that it doesn&#8217;t add too much to the thickness. To keep it closed when moving it about I just use a largish rubber band.

The case is starting to look a bit scuffed up now after a couple of months use, but I don&#8217;t mind this too much, so long as it holds together which it should do with the strips of Gaffa tape fixed on the inside of the spine. Overall I love it as it disguises the iPad, is light and doesn&#8217;t mask the curved contours of the iPad making it much nicer to hold. You can even position it in a standing / propped up position for watching your favourite <a title="TED: Ideas worth spreading" href="https://www.ted.com/" target="_blank">TED</a> talks on.

The book that the cover came from is still usable too; glueing it&#8217;s dust jacket back onto it means it&#8217;s now become a paperback!
