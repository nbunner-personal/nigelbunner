I wrote a book of short stories to accompany my debut album in March 2016. Each story was about a song from the album and is still available in a [limited print edition](http://shop.sugardrum.com/), free when you buy a CD copy of the album.

The book is also available to [download from Amazon](https://read.amazon.co.uk/kp/embed?asin=B01N3OBT3W&preview=newtab&linkCode=kpe&ref_=cm_sw_r_kb_dp_k9XsybYE50G27) in Kindle format, retitled as &quot;For you I hide this&quot;.

<blockquote>	
    <h3>For you I hide this</h3>
    <p>A fascinating collection of twelve short stories drawn from Nigelâ€™s experiences and imagination. A magical trail under the stairs offers a glimpse into a future self, the hidden words written on postcards on a wall, a cat who tries to break free from its natural instinct to eat everything that moves, the joy of taking the day off to play in a snow covered landscape and the heartfelt tale of living with dementia. Each story is based on a song from Nigel's debut album Postcards performing as indie folk artist Sugardrum.</p>
