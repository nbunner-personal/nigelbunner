I now have a permanant contract doing web design for a large travel website, so this page has now become more of an archive of some of the projects I have worked on in the past.

I have split these up into websites that I have either designed &amp; coded and sites which I have just coded up from someone elses design. The second of these involves converting a design in Photoshop format into HTML and for some of them I have offered advice on the design based on my experience in website usability. In both cases all the HTML, JavaScript and CSS is handcoded except for a few Javascript plugins and the site is either created using Wordpress, custom PHP templates or as a Jekyll static site.

	<p>This is one of the charity websites I work on for gratis. I was responsible for the redesign, coding and restructuring of the site, using an existing logo design and the subsequenting rebranding of the site after the charity changed their name.</p>

	<h3><a href="http://www.cave.coop/" title="Visit www.cave.coop">www.cave.coop</a></h3>
	<p>The Cave Co-operative specialise in Sustainable Architecture. They came up with some nice design ideas for the site such as a general style guide for the colour and typography and prepared most of the main images themselves. I helped them with the overal layout, coding the site and putting all our ideas together in to a responsive design.</p>

	<p>Earthsong provide multicultural workshops for schools. The website proved to be quite a challenge at first as the design they provided was mainly image based. Fortunately I was able to prevent the load time from becoming to slow by merging most of the images into sprites and streamlining the code as much as poosible.</p>
