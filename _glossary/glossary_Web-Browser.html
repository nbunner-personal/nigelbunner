<p>A web browser is a piece of software on your computer that you use to view pages from the internet. If you're reading this, you're using a web browser right now.</p> 
<p>There are various different browsers around. The most commonly used was <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-gb/help/17621/internet-explorer-downloads">Internet Explorer</a> but now <a href="http://www.google.co.uk/chrome">Google Chrome</a> is more commonly used. Microsoft has since brought out a new browser called <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-gb/windows/microsoft-edge">Edge</a> but there are other browsers too also worth checking out such as <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-GB/firefox/new/">Firefox</a>, <a href="http://www.opera.com/">Opera</a> and <a href="https://www.apple.com/uk/safari/">Safari</a> which is more commonly used on the Apple Mac, iPhone and iPad.</p>
