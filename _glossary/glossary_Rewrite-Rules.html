<p>A module on an Apache Web server that can be used to manipulate the data passed in to a Web URL, for example redirecting the user to a <a href="/glossary/glossary_PHP.html">PHP</a> page with various variables being passed in at the same time.</p> 
<p>The page you are looking at now uses rewrite rules to pass the selected Glossary Term to a PHP page which then gets the information for that term from a data file.</p>
<p>The upshot is it means the website can have more Google Friendly URL's, eg</p>
<pre>
http://www.nigelbunner.co.uk/glossary_Rewrite-Rules.html
</pre>
<p>instead of</p>
<pre>
http://www.nigelbunner.co.uk/glossary_page.php?search_term=Rewrite-Rules
