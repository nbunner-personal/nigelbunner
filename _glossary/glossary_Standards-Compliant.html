<p>All the web sites I create are coded with consideration made of the HTML guidelines recommended by The <a href="http://www.w3.org/">World Wide Web Consortium (W3C)</a>. By following these guidelines and making their code Standards Complient Web Designers can help ensure their designs look and work the same across the wide range of Web Browsers available, including <a href="http://www.afb.org/ProdBrowseCatResults.asp?CatID=49">Screen Readers</a> and Browsers used by the Blind and Visually Impaired.</p>
