<p>A Scripting Language developed by Netscape that runs via a Web Browser. It is different to Java and PHP in that the code runs entirely in the users web browser rather than on the server. It's uses are both numerous and powerful, from simple scripts to validating the data being passed to a form to more complex scripts that form the basis of more advanced web technologies like Ajax.</p> 

<p>Javascript has advanced much since it's humble beginnings and is now widely used across the internet. Some of it's more advanced uses include a web server called node.js, online computer games and recreations of desktop applications in the browser such as word processors, code editors and graphics programmes.</p>
