title: What are HTML emails?

<p>Whenever you get a fancy email from a company containing pictures or a cool layout the code used to display the Email is usually written using a combination of <a href="/glossary/glossary_CSS.html">CSS</a> and <a href="/glossary/glossary_HTML.html">HTML</a>, much the same as on a website. However, some email clients display HTML emails differently to others and special considerations need to be made to allow for this.</p> 
<p>Not everyone uses Microsoft Outlook, many people use web based email clients such as Hotmail or Gmail and if the HTML Emails are not coded and tested with this in mind they can end up looking vastly different to how they were originally intended.</p>
<p>I have considerable experience in coding HTML Emails across the majority of Desktop and Webased email clients.</p>
